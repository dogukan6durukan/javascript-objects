# Javascript Practices
This project is for practicing my Javascript knowledge. I created a bunch of things to see what can I achieve or which one I can use in my real-life projects. 

I will continue to make and implement different things as I force my brain to find out new things.

This project is separated into different folders and each of them are including its relative code solutions. Each solution's result is initially commented. You can also try these solutions on your own and if you find any missing thing or worth to adding or removing you can contribute it.

By default, you can test the results on your browser dev tool and the initial running file is `objects/main.js`.

Have a nice coding.
